<p>Subnautica is an underwater survival game on planet 4546B where your goal is to escape and return back home. The game begins with the Aurora, your
 spaceship, crash landing in the ocean, but you're able to escape on lifepod #5, one of 9 lifepods to succesfully land in the ocean. However, 
 you will soon find that you're the only survivor. In order to escape you will need to gather resources in dangerous biomes, face vicious 
 alien fauna, and collect data in abandoned lifepods, and alien precursor bases to construct a device to set you free. But before you escape, 
 you'll need to cure and eradicate the planet's dissease. check out the Subnautica wiki <a class="wiki" href="https://subnautica.fandom.com/wiki/Subnautica_Wiki">here.</a></p>

<p>My personal experience with Subnautica has been phenomenal. Subnautica is by far my favourite survival game ever played, with the amazing graphics
mysterious music, and smooth gameplay, it realy makes you feel like you yourself are on this alien planet. Sometimes, while playing subnautica, I 
thought harder than I ever have at school just to come up with a strategies to go inside the aurora, whilst escpaing the leviathion. All in all, I love 
this game and highly recomend it to anybody who's interested in playing it.</p>
