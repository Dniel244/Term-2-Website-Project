<center><h1>Subnautica</h1></center>

<p>Subnautica is an underwater survival game on planet 4546B where your goal is to escape and return back home. The game begins with the Aurora, the
 spaceship you are aboard, crash landing in the ocean, but you're able to escape on lifepod #5, one of 9 lifepods to succesfully land in the ocean. However, 
 you will soon find that you're the only survivor. In order to escape you will need to gather resources in dangerous biomes, face vicious 
 alien fauna, and collect data in abandoned lifepods, and alien precursor bases to construct a device to set you free. But before you escape, 
 you'll need to cure and eradicate the planet's dissease.</p>

	<center><h1>Personal Experience</h1></center>
	
<p>My personal experience with Subnautica has been phenomenal. Subnautica is by far my favourite survival game ever played, with the amazing graphics
mysterious music, and smooth gameplay, it realy makes you feel like you yourself are on this alien planet. Sometimes, while playing subnautica, I 
will always remember my first encounter with a reaper leviathan as being one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. All in all, I love 
this game and highly recomend it to anybody who's interested in playing it.</p>

<p>The DLC (downloadable content) for Subnautica is Subnautica: Below Zero, which takes place on a different part of
the same planet, but with different characters. In Below Zero you are'nt trying to escape, rather you're researching
the Zero sector of the planet, but things don't go to smoothly. Below Zero is currently in early access and being updated
with tons of cool features the original game doesn't have. One of the new features is the hoverbike</p>
